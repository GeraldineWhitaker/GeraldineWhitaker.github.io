Databases Enhancement Narrative 

The artifact that I used is originally my IT-145 Foundation in Application Development class that I took over two years ago, with the added enhancements from both the software design and engineering enhancement and the algorithms and data structures enhancements. The concept of this project was that the company, Grazioso Salvare, uses dogs and monkeys as search and rescue animals, and put the animals in training prior to being in service. The enhancements that I made during the software design and engineering phase were rewriting the code in Python and implementing role-based access using username and passwords.  The enhancements that I made during the algorithms and data structures phase were improving reservation logic, training status updates, as well as searching for animals.   

I chose this single artifact for all three of my enhancements for my ePortfolio because it is the best one to use to effectively show my skills and complete the course outcomes for all five of the enhancements. Rather than making small enhancements across three different projects, I liked the idea of taking one project that was extremely simple and lacked security, logic, and long-term storage, and fixing these problems by the end of all the enhancements. During the database enhancement, I took the project from a local, in memory system into a data-driven application that supports searching, updates, and reservations through a web interface. The course outcomes that I met with these enhancements were employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science and demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. The enhancements made during this phase make the Grazioso Salvare Rescue System accessible, readable, and informative by presenting clear data with an organized user interface, which builds collaborative environments and enables diverse audiences to support organization decision making. I also demonstrated my ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools by using Flask for routing and templating and MongoDB for data storage.  

The only change that I made from my original plan was dropping the role-based access that was implemented during the software design and engineering phase using username and password authentication. Although role-based access would have been an appropriate addition to the web application, it added complexity and additional challenges that did not contribute to the main enhancements that I wanted to implement during this phase. Because I already met the security mind set outcome during the first enhancement, I decided it was not necessary to keep during this enhancement. However, I did not drop all security from the project. I kept input validation and added a Flask secret key to protect session data and flash messages.
