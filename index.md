## **Self Assessment**

Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has provided me with the opportunity to reflect on my academic growth, technical development, and professional readiness. Throughout the program, I have strengthened my ability to design computing solutions, clearly communicate technical concepts, apply software engineering principles, and approach development with a security mindset. This portfolio demonstrates not only the successful completion of my capstone experience but also my readiness to contribute to professional environments in the field of computer science. 

Rather than developing three separate projects for my enhancements, I chose to expand upon a single application originally created in my IT 145 Foundation in Application Development course. The concept of the original project was that the company, Grazioso Salvare, trains dogs and monkeys as search and rescue animals. At the time, the application was a simple Java console program without security considerations or a web interface, and had limited business logic. For my capstone, I transformed this project into a more comprehensive system by integrating database functionality, applying structured software engineering principles, incorporating security considerations, and developing an HTML-based interface. This approach allowed me to demonstrate growth over time and illustrate how programming knowledge can evolve into a more robust and maintainable solution. Rewriting the entire application in Python allowed me to demonstrate language adaptability and my ability to translate logic across platforms. 

Throughout this program, I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in computer science. Through assignments and discussions completed throughout various classes, I developed a stronger understanding of working effectively in group settings, gathered and interpreted stakeholder requirements, and translated technical constraints into understandable outcomes. This understanding strengthened my ability to contribute to shared decision-making processes while ensuring that computing solutions align with organizational needs and user expectations. 

In addition to collaboration, I developed the ability to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences. This is reflected in the structured documentation of my enhancements, the clarity of my code review presentation, and the organization of this ePortfolio. Whether explaining database indexing decisions, algorithmic trade-offs, or security improvements, communicating technical concepts clearly has been an essential skill developed throughout my coursework. 

My coursework strengthened my ability to design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles and computer science standards while managing design trade-offs. In enhancing the Grazioso Salvare application, I applied data structures and logical organization to improve maintainability and performance. I evaluated different approaches to storing and retrieving data and selected MongoDB as a flexible database solution that supported scalability and structured querying. Throughout this process, I considered trade-offs between simplicity and efficiency. For example, implementing structured database queries and indexing introduced additional configuration complexity but improved time complexity for data retrieval operations, demonstrating analytical decision-making aligned with industry standards. 

The integration of MongoDB and structured indexing into the application reflects my ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices. By transitioning from temporary in-memory storage to persistent database-backed storage, I improved data integrity, reliability, and scalability. Implementing unique indexes to prevent duplicate records and organizing code into modular components demonstrates my ability to apply industry-relevant tools and best practices to deliver value-driven computing solutions. 

Security awareness has been another critical area of growth. Throughout the program, I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits and potential vulnerabilities in software architecture. In this project, I incorporated input validation and role-based access with authentication and authorization. While usernames and passwords remain hardcoded in this academic implementation for simplicity, I understand that in a production environment credentials would be securely stored using environment variables, hashing, and secure authentication mechanisms. This decision was made to maintain project scope while still demonstrating an understanding of authentication flow and access control concepts.

The artifacts included in this ePortfolio collectively demonstrate my ability to meet all five of the course outcomes of this project. The original application provides room for improvement, while each enhancement highlights a distinct area of development, software engineering and design refinement, algorithmic and structural improvements, database integration, and security considerations. Overall, completing this program has shaped both my professional goals and my approach to computing. I value maintainable design, clear communication, secure development practices, and thoughtful evaluation of trade-offs in problem solving. This ePortfolio serves not only as evidence of my technical abilities but also as a reflection of my readiness to enter the computer science field with competence, adaptability, and a commitment to continuous growth.
