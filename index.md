Self Assessment 

Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has allowed me to reflect on both my technical growth and my professional development. Throughout the program, I have gained experience in programming, data management, security principles, and software engineering practices that have prepared me to enter the computer science field with confidence. The capstone enhancements in this portfolio demonstrate not only my technical abilities, but also my growth mindset, problem-solving skills, and commitment to continuous improvement.  
  
Rather than developing three unrelated projects for my enhancements, I chose to expand upon a single foundational application originally created in my IT 145 Foundation in Application Development course. The original project simulated a system used by Grazioso Salvare, a company that trains dogs and monkeys for search and rescue operations. At the time, the application was a simple Java based program without a database, security considerations, or a web interface. During the process of each enhancement, I transformed that basic application into a more comprehensive system by integrating database functionality, security practices, and an HTML-based interface. This approach allowed me to demonstrate how foundational programming knowledge can evolve into a more robust and industry aligned appllication.   

Throughout my coursework, I developed proficiency in many different coding languages and strengthened my understanding of data structures and algorithms. I learned how to analyze time and space complexity, implement efficient data handling techniques, and select appropriate structures for different scenarios. In enhancing the Grazioso Salvare project, I applied this knowledge by organizing animal data effectively and implementing structured data management using MongoDB. Understanding how data is stored, retrieved, and indexed allowed me to design a more scalable and maintainable system compared to the original version.    

Security awareness has been a critical area of growth throughout my program. Coursework in software security and secure coding practices helped me understand the importance of protecting sensitive information and preventing vulnerabilities. In this project, I maintained a security mindset by implementing input validation and understanding session management through the use of a secret key. I approached this project with professional standards in mind, recognizing that secure development practices are essential in real world environments.    

Collaboration and communication have also been central components of my education. Through discussions and assignments, I developed the ability to communicate technical concepts clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences. Understanding stakeholder needs, translating requirements into functional software solutions, and documenting design decisions are skills I have strengthened throughout the program. These abilities are reflected in this portfolio through the structured explanations of each enhancement and the accompanying code review, where I go over technical decisions and justify implementation choices.  

The enhancements included in this ePortfolio collectively demonstrate the progression of my technical skills. Each enhancement builds upon the last, introducing database integration, improved structure, security considerations, and a user-facing interface. Together, these artifacts illustrate my ability to take a simple concept and improve it into a more comprehensive and professional project.  
 
Overall, completing this program has shaped both my professional goals and values. I value thoughtful design, maintainable code, and secure development practices. I have learned to approach problems analytically, communicate solutions clearly, and continuously refine my skills. This ePortfolio represents not just a collection of technical artifacts, but a demonstration of my readiness to contribute meaningfully to the computer science field and to continue growing as a technology professional.
